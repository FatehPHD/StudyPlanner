Great—let’s zero in on the next piece. Here are a few areas we haven’t touched yet—pick whichever you’d like to tackle next (or let me know something else on your mind):

Date-picker inputs in the parser preview (swap those free-form date fields for <input type="date"> or a React date picker so dates are guaranteed valid).

Mobile responsiveness—tweak your CSS/layout so the calendar, tables, and forms look great on phones.

PDF/Word syllabus import—add file upload + text extraction so users don’t have to copy/paste manually.

Drag-and-drop calendar—let people drag events to reschedule deadlines.

Styling polish—tighten up margins, fonts, and colors; add animations for a more native feel.

Error handling & loading states—show spinners, catch edge-cases, build out your ErrorBoundary fallback pages.

Deploying backend—get Flask running on an HTTPS domain (Heroku, Vercel Serverless, Railway, etc.) and update your front-end fetch URLs.
